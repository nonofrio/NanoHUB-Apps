This app displays the projected density of state (PDOS) of various doped transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs).
The user can pick between two doping types:

- substitution
- interstitial

The TMD type:

- Mo, W
- S, Se and Te

The dopant can be selected by cliking the element on the periodic table (up to row 5).
Simulation details are presented https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10745
